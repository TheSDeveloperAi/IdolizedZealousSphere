Terminal Sales Processing System (Python). This command-line application provides a structured way to manage sales orders. It allows users to select products with calculated pricing, discounts, and taxes. The system also tracks seller, customer, and transport details, calculates seller commissions, and supports defining custom payment installment plans with a clear payment schedule summary.
